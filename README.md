This is my experiment to predict Daily Cases of Covid-19 in Indonesia based on data that i collect from **KawalCovid**. Partial data taken from 1 July 2021 - 14 November 2021.

I'm using Polynomial Regression and Linear Regression to predict Covid-19 daily cases in Indonesia.

Accuracy of this model is:
## ðŸŽ‰ 93% ðŸŽ‰

Hope you get anything from this repo :D
